## 🔍 Overview

Unscheduled maintenance in the aerospace and heavy machinery industries is one of the costliest operational challenges. A single unexpected engine failure can ground an aircraft, delay hundreds of passengers, and cost millions of dollars.

This project addresses that challenge head-on by building a **Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)** system that:

- 📊 **Ingests** raw time-series sensor data from turbofan engines
- 🧹 **Engineers** meaningful features and removes noisy/constant sensors
- 🤖 **Trains** a deep LSTM network to predict how many cycles remain before failure
- 📈 **Visualises** predictions and sensor trends on a live Streamlit dashboard

> *"Predict failure before it happens — not after."*

## 📡 Dataset

**Source:** [NASA C-MAPSS Jet Engine Simulated Data](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/cmapss-jet-engine-simulated-data)

The **Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)** dataset was generated by NASA using a thermodynamic turbofan engine simulator. This project uses the **FD001** subset.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Training engines | 100 units |
| Test engines | 100 units |
| Operating conditions | 1 |
| Fault modes | 1 (HPC degradation) |
| Sensors | 21 time-series measurements |
| Features used | 14 (after dropping constant/low-signal sensors) |

### Sensor Selection

After correlation analysis, the following low-information sensors were **dropped**:

`setting_1`, `setting_2`, `setting_3`, `s_1`, `s_5`, `s_6`, `s_10`, `s_14`, `s_16`, `s_18`, `s_19`

The **14 remaining sensors** (e.g. `s_2`, `s_3`, `s_4`, `s_7`, `s_11`, `s_12`) carry meaningful degradation signals and are used as model inputs.

### Target Variable — RUL

```
RUL = max_cycle - current_cycle   (clipped at 125 cycles)
```

Clipping at 125 cycles reflects the real-world assumption that early-life behaviour is stable and unpredictable; only the degradation phase is modelled.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Preprocessing Pipeline

```
Raw sensor data
      │
      ▼
Min-Max Normalization  ← fit on TRAIN only (no data leakage)
      │
      ▼
Sliding Window  →  sequences of shape (50 time steps × 14 features)
      │
      ▼
LSTM Network
```

### LSTM Network

```
Input  →  (batch, 50 time steps, 14 features)
      │
      ▼  LSTM Layer 1 — 128 units, tanh, return_sequences=True
      ▼  Batch Normalisation
      ▼  Dropout (0.2)
      │
      ▼  LSTM Layer 2 — 64 units, tanh
      ▼  Dropout (0.2)
      │
      ▼  Dense — 32 units, ReLU
      ▼  Dense — 1 unit  (RUL regression output)
```

**Loss:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
**Optimizer:** Adam  
**Early Stopping:** patience = 10 epochs (monitors `val_loss`, restores best weights)

### Hyperparameter Tuning

An additional tuning pass was performed using **Keras Tuner (RandomSearch)** over:

| Hyperparameter | Search Range |
|---|---|
| LSTM units (layer 1) | 32 → 128 (step 32) |
| LSTM units (layer 2) | 32 → 64 (step 32) |
| Dropout rate | 0.1 → 0.3 |
| Learning rate | 1e-4 → 1e-2 |

The best configuration was re-trained for 50 epochs with the learning rate capped at `0.001` to avoid LSTM gradient instability.

## 📊 Results

| Metric | Baseline LSTM | Optimized LSTM |
|---|---|---|
| **RMSE** (cycles) | — | < 20 |
| **MAE** (cycles) | — | — |
| **NASA S-Score** | — | — |

> Exact values are printed at the end of `RUL_NasaEngineFinal.ipynb` after running all cells. Baseline metrics were not logged separately; the optimized model targets an RMSE below 20 cycles, which is considered **highly effective** for this benchmark.

**Evaluation plots generated by the notebook:**
- Training vs. Validation Loss (MSE & MAE)
- Actual RUL vs. Predicted RUL scatter plot
- Sensor degradation trend (per engine unit)

## 🖥️ Live Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard (`app.py`) lets you interactively inspect any engine unit from the test set.

**Features:**
- 🎛️ Sidebar unit selector (Unit 1 – 100)
- 🔢 Live RUL prediction metric (cycles remaining)
- 📉 Pressure sensor (s_11) trend chart
- 🛠️ Debugging panel showing data availability per unit

**Screenshot preview:**
